    "# L2 Scraping Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "L2 data is our second level of unlabeled data. Here, we are collecting articles and webpages on the 7 topics that we are deciding candidates' opinions on. The 7 topics that have been selected are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Guns - Should the US have stricter gun control?\n",
    "2. Immgiration - Should we open up our borders and grant a path to citizenship for current undocumented immigrants?\n",
    "3. Healthcare - Should we support Meidcare for all?\n",
    "4. Abortion - Does the woman have a right to choose to continue with pregnancy?\n",
    "5. College - Should higher education be free?\n",
    "6. Military - Should we increase military spending?\n",
    "7. Taxes - Should we implement a tax on extreme wealth?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, while there are other issues that are relavent to the election, the omission of those topics from a platform is more indicative than statements that are actually against that issue. For example, political candidates who do not support the fight against climate change are more likely to not discuss climate change in their platforms rather than say that climate change is a hoax."
